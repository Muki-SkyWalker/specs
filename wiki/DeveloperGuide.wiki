= Get the source code =

All the source code of *specs* is kept in [http://specs.googlecode.com/svn the Subversion repository] of the project.

= How is the versioning managed? =

The code for the release 1.1 is kept in a branch named [http://specs.googlecode.com/svn/branches/SPECS-1.1]

The official 1.0 release has the tag: SPECS-1.1

This branch will get every bug fix on the 1.1 release and each bugfix release will be tagged SPECS-1.1x, x being the number of the bugfix release for version 1.1.


=How to compile specs?=

The easiest way to compile the project is to:
  * get eclipse + [http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads/eclipse the stable scala plugin]
  * create an eclipse/Scala project for the spec sources 
  * include the scalacheck jar + junit3.8.1.jar in the classpath

There is a buildr file included in the repository but this is only a prototype and can not be used until there is an official support for Scala in [http://buildr.rubyforge.org Buildr].
