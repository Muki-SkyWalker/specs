#summary If you want to hack and extend specs

= Get the source code =

All the source code of *specs* is kept in [http://specs.googlecode.com/svn the Subversion repository] of the project.[,,In the RC1 release part of the code was managed in another project. Everything has been grouped for easier management,,]

= How is the versioning managed? =

The code for the release 1.0 is kept in a branch named [http://specs.googlecode.com/svn/branches/SPECS-1.0]

The official 1.0 release has the tag: SPECS-1.0

This branch will get every bug fix on the 1.0 release and each bugfix release will be tagged SPECS-1.0x, x being the number of the bugfix release for version 1.0.


=How to compile specs?=

The easiest way to compile the project is to:
  * get eclipse + [the stable scala plugin http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads/eclipse]
  * create an eclipse/Scala project for the spec sources 
  * include the ScalaCheck jar + junit3.8.1.jar in the classpath

There is a buildr file included in the repository but this is only a prototype and can not be used until there is an official support for Scala in [http://buildr.rubyforge.org Buildr].
