#summary If you want to hack and extend specs

= Get _all_ the source code =

Most of the source code of *specs* is kept in [http://specs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ the Subversion repository] of the project.

However, there are a few classes which complete the picture, and those classes belong to another Google code project: [http://code.google.com/p/scala-utils scala-utils] (sources [http://scala-utils.googlecode.com/svn/trunk here]).

Those classes have been kept separate since they can be reused in other Scala projects.


===How to compile specs?===

The easiest way to compile the project is to:
  * to create an eclipse project for the scala-utils sources
  * to create an eclipse project for the spec sources (using the scalacheck jar + the scala-utils project + junit3 in the classpath)

There is a buildr file included in the repository but this is only a prototype and can not be used until there is an official support for Scala in [http://buildr.rubyforge.org Buildr].
