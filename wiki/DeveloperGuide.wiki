#summary If you want to hack and extend specs

= Get _all_ the source code =

Most of the source code of *specs* is kept in [http://specs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ the Subversion repository] of the project.

However, there are a few classes which complete the picture, and those classes belong to another Google code project: [http://code.google.com/p/scala-utils scala-utils] (sources [http://scala-utils.googlecode.com/svn/trunk here]).

Those classes have been kept separate since they can be reused in other Scala projects.
