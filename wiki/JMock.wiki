= Introduction =

[http://www.jmock.org/ jMock2] allows to define mocks and expectations on mocks very easily.

This page shows how to use jMock with specs. Please refer to the jMock site for more instructions on jMock itself.

= Libraries =

In order to use jMock2 with specs, you need to add the following dependencies to your project: jmock-2.4.0, hamcrest-1.1 and cglib-2.1_3 + objenesis-1.0 if you want to mock classes. Here is a sample maven snippet to realize this
{{{
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.jmock</groupId>
      <artifactId>jmock</artifactId>
      <version>2.4.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <!-- included for documentation but redundant since they are a dependency of jmock-2.4.0
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.hamcrest</groupId>
      <artifactId>hamcrest-core</artifactId>
      <version>1.1</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.hamcrest</groupId>
      <artifactId>hamcrest-library</artifactId>
      <version>1.1</version>
    </dependency>
    -->   
    <!-- Those are only needing if you want to mock classes -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>cglib</groupId>
      <artifactId>cglib</artifactId>
      <version>2.1_3</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.objenesis</groupId>
      <artifactId>objenesis</artifactId>
      <version>1.0</version>
    </dependency>
}}}

= A simple mock example with specs and jMock =

Using mocks follows a 4 steps process:

   1. extend the JMocker trait and add ClassMocker if you want to mock classes as well as interfaces:
{{{
import scala.specs.mock._
object mySpec extends Specification with JMocker with ClassMocker {...}
}}}
*Tt is especially important that JMocker is mixed-in with your Specification, otherwise the expectations won't be checked*

   2. create mock objects using the `mock` method
{{{
object mySpec extends Specification with JMocker with ClassMocker {
  "my system" should {
    "use mocks" in {
      val mockedService = mock(classOf[Service])
    }
  }
}
}}}

   3. add expectations in your specification example
{{{
object mySpec extends Specification with JMocker with ClassMocker {
  "my system" should {
    "use mocks" in {
      val mockedService = mock(classOf[Service])
      expect {
        one(mockedService).executeService() // this will be called one time exactly
      }
      ...
    }
  }
}
}}}
   4. use the mock in the rest of your example, expectations will be automatically checked at the end of the example 

=A complete example=

Here is a complete example of the use of mocks to specify the interactions between a `Button` and a `Light` object:
{{{
trait ButtonAndLightMock extends ButtonAndLight with JMocker with ClassMocker {
  val mock = mock(classOf[Light])
  val button = Button(mock)
}
trait ButtonAndLight {
  case class Button(light: Light) {
    var lightOn = false
    def push = {
      if (lightOn) light.off else light.on 
      lightOn = !lightOn
    }
  }
  case class Light {
    var state: LightState = Off
    def on = state = On
    def off = state = Off
    def isOn = state == On
  }
  abstract sealed class LightState(s: String)
  case class On extends LightState("on")
  case class Off extends LightState("off")
}

object mockExample extends Specification with ButtonAndLightMock {
  "A button and light mock example" should {
    "not fail if the mock receives the expected messages" in {
      expect {
        one(mock).on
        one(mock).off
      }
      button.push
      button.push  // if the button is pressed twice, then the light will go on and off
    }
  }
}
}}}

= Methods expectations =

==Methods counters==
All the standard jMock method expectations are available with specs. However, a little bit of syntactic sugar has been added:
{{{
  expect {
    exactly(2).of(mock).on // is equivalent to 
    2.of(mock).on

    atLeast(2).of(mock).on // is equivalent to 
    2.atLeastOf(mock).on

  }
}}}

==Allowing or ignoring methods==

Some shortcuts are available to allow or ignore some method calls:
{{{
  expect {
    allowingMatching("on") // allow any method called "on"
    ignoringMatching("on") // ignore any method called "on"
  }
}}}

However you can specify that the calls must happen in sequence:

  expect(inSequence) { mock.on; mock.off }

You can also specify that unexpected calls must be reported as failures:

  expect(exclusively) { mock.on; mock.off }

Repeated calls

You may want to be even more precise when specifying mock expectations by using the following ProtocolTypes:

    * anyOf: any of the expected calls

       expect(anyOf) {mock.on; mock.off}

    * oneOf: the expected calls must be received 1 time only

       expect(oneOf) {mock.on; mock.off}
       3.times {i => button.push} // will fail

    * n.Of: the expected calls must be received n times only

       expect(5.Of) {mock.on}

    * atLeastOneOf: the expected calls must be received at least once
    * n.atLeastOf: the expected calls must be received at least n times 

    * atMostOneOf: the expected calls must be received at most once
    * n.atMostOf: the expected calls must be received at most n times 

Nested expectations

You can also nest expectations to build more sophisticated expectations. In that case, you can even avoid the expect function:

 expect(exclusively) {
   1.of {mock.on; mock.off; mock.on} 
   1.of {mock.off} 
 }

Return values and expected parameter values
How to stub return values

You may want your mock to return specific values sometimes (using it effectively as a stub). In that case, you can use the recordAndReturn method to return a specific value:

trait MockedRandomGenerator extends RandomGenerator with Mocker {
  // will always return 0.5
  override def getRandomNumber: Double = recordAndReturn(0.5)
}

If the return value depends on the mocked method parameters, you can use a function to compute the returned value, using the method parameters (see here for an example)
How to define expected parameters

You may want to check that the parameters passed to the mocked method verify some specific constraints. In order to do that, you need to build your mock object accordingly. Here's n example:

  // define a mock with a function which will check the passed parameters
  def buildMock(f: (Int, Movie) => Boolean) = {
    new MovieRater {
      override def okForAge(a: Int, m: Movie) =  recordAndReturn(f(a, m))
    }
  }
  // create a new mock object checking that the age is > 0
  val mock = buildMock((a: Int, m: Movie) => {a must beGreaterThan(0); true})

How to avoid to create complex parameters in expectations

Some methods can only be called with complex objects as parameters. Thus, it can be tedious when defining expected calls because such objects need to be build first. In order to avoid this, you can use the any function:

 expect {
   mock.methodWithComplexParameter(any[ComplexType])
 }
