#summary Pitfalls and errors that you can avoid
#labels Featured

This page lists tips on errors you may encounter while using *specs*.

  * *!NoSuchMethodError*. You may have dependencies issues. Please check the version numbers of all the libraries you're using: [http://code.google.com/p/specs/wiki/RunningSpecs#Dependencies dependencies]

  * *Strange compilation error*. The following spec would raise a compilation error:
{{{
"My Thing" should {
  "do something" {
     ...possibly long setup...
     something must ... other // matcher
  }
}}}}

This would generate:
{{{error: type mismatch;
   found   : org.specs.specification.Result[java.lang.String]
   required: Int
}}}

  This is because there is a missing "in" after the example description, so everything inside the accolade is expected to be an Int used to access one character of "do something" (see issue 22)
