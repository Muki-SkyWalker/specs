#summary Using Mockito mocks and stubs.

(*from 1.4.4*)

*This is a draft, work in progress!!!!*

= Introduction =

[http://mockito.googlecode.com Mockito] is a mocking library which "lets you write beautiful tests with clean & simple API".

*specs* integrates Mockito expectations and add some syntactic sugar for an even simpler experience of Mockito.

= Usage =

In order to use Mockito mocks in your specification, you need to mix in the Mockito trait.

{{{
  
  object spec extends Specification with Mockito {
    
    val m = mock[java.util.List[String]] // a concrete class would be mocked with: mock(new java.util.LinkedList[String])
    
    // stub a method call with a return value
    m.get(0) returns "one"
  
    // call the method
    m.get(0)
  
    // verify that the call happened, this is an expectation which will throw a FailureException if that is not the case
    m.get(0) was called
    
    // we can also check that another call did not occur
    m.get(1) wasnt called // or m.get(1) was notCalled
                          
  }
