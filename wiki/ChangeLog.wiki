||1/25/2008|| *specs* 1.2.1 || lifted the typing restriction on the `be_==` matcher (introduced in 1.1.5) and added a new beEqual matcher which constrains both values to have compatible types. This still leaves one typing issue for the beEqual matcher on Iterables. See [http://code.google.com/p/specs/wiki/MatchersGuide#Matchers_applicable_to_any_object here]||
||1/23/2008|| *specs* 1.2 || jMock can now be used to create mocks and define expectations - see the [http://code.google.com/p/specs/wiki/UsingJMock wiki]. 2 matchers have been added for !PartialFunctions: beDefinedAt and beDefinedWith||

||1/5/2008||*specs* 1.1.4. ||corrected a bug involving multiple evaluation of an expression to be tested. In a mustBe b, a was evaluated 3 times. ||
||1/3/2008||*specs* 1.1.3. ||the specs declared as a JUnit3 !TestSuite can now be executed with JUnit4. The consequence is that specs now depends on JUnit-4.4||
