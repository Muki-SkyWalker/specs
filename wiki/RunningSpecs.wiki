=Run your specification on the Console=

To execute your specification in a Console you need to use the `ConsoleRunner` class:
{{{
import scala.specs.runner.ConsoleRunner

object mySpecRunner extends ConsoleRunner(mySpec)

object mySpec extends Specification { ... }

}}}

===How to redirect the results on a different output===

If you want to redirect the result of the execution to a file for example, you have to create a new trait extending the `Output` trait:
{{{
trait FileOutput extends Output {
  def println(m: Any) = {...}
  def printf(format: String, args: Any*) = {...}
  def flush() = {...}
}
}}}

And then you "mix" it with the `ConsoleRunner`:
{{{
object mySpecRunner extends ConsoleRunner(mySpec) with FileOutput
object mySpec extends Specification { ... }
}}}
