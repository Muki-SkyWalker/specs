===Introduction===
*specs* is designed as a remplacement for JUnit when specifying and testing Java or Scala projects. Yet, it is able to reuse the existing JUnit infrastructure for execution and reporting since the specifications can be executed as JUnit3 test suites.

*specs* also integrates an innovative feature, the [http://code.google.com/p/scalacheck/ scalacheck] project in order to be able to generate a numerous cases testing a given property.

*specs* takes its inspiration from existing frameworks:

  * [http://rspec.rubyforge.org/ rspec] for trying to have a literal structure to specifications and assertions and also for the possibility to share examples between related specifications (as in the Stack example).

  * [http://www.jmock.org jmock] for having reusable matchers and expressive assertions. 

===User Guide===
This User Guide is divided in 7 parts:

  * [QuickStart 5 minutes to your first specification]
  * [DeclareSpecifications Declare your specifications]
  * [MatchersGuide The full guide to specs matchers]
  * [RunningSpecs How to run your specifications]
